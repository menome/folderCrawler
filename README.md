# File Crawler

## Setup

1. On a windows machine, download and install NodeJS
2. Install GIT shell 
3. Open a powershell terminal after install 
4. Navigate to the download directory and run `npm install` 

## Usage

You can either use `npm start` to run the application as a web microservice. Sending a POST request to `/crawl` will cause the application to crawl the folders.

Alternatively, run `npm run exec` to simply crawl the folders once and exit.
